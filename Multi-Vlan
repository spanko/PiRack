Revisiting the PiRack project and breathing new life into it - I'm now taking one of the pi's and configuring it to sit across all of my VLANs, or at least those that have distinct egress points configured.  
Generally, the plan is:
- Enable VLAN on the Rpi
- Configure the VLANs to reflect what I have setup on my router and switch
- Create a docker network for each VLAN
- Build out multiple docker-compose.yml files - one for each vlan - for speedtest
- Deploy a speedtest container on each VLAN so I can get regulard speedtests on each WAN (I have 3)
- Fgure out how to aggregate and report on that data

#Enabling Vlan usage

'sudo apt-get install vlan'
'sudo su -c 'echo "8021q" >> /etc/modules'

Now you are vlan-enabled, let's do something with it.  Here I'm assuming we're using the default Ubuntu network manager.

'sudo nano /etc/netplan/50-cloud-init.yaml'
